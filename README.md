# BlockchainSecurityScanner

This repository hosts the development of an advanced blockchain security scanner designed to identify and analyze vulnerabilities in smart contracts, with a particular focus on those written in Vyper. Our tool equips developers and security researchers with critical insights into the security posture of their smart contracts, enabling proactive risk mitigation and the creation of more robust blockchain applications.

## Vision Statement

Our vision is to become a leading provider of open-source tools and resources that enhance the security of blockchain ecosystems. We strive to empower developers with the knowledge and instruments necessary to build secure, reliable, and trustworthy smart contracts. By fostering a culture of security and promoting best practices, we aim to contribute to the long-term growth and sustainability of the blockchain industry.

## Key Features

- **Vulnerability Detection for Vyper Contracts**: Identify common security issues specific to Vyper smart contracts, such as integer overflows, reentrancy, and access control vulnerabilities.
- **Static and Dynamic Analysis**: Utilize both static code analysis and dynamic testing to provide comprehensive security assessments.
- **Integration with Popular Blockchain Platforms**: Seamlessly integrate with Ethereum and other EVM-compatible blockchains to analyze deployed contracts.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Offer an intuitive interface that simplifies interaction for both novice and experienced users.
- **Regular Security Updates**: Continuously update the scanner to address emerging threats and incorporate the latest security best practices.

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Languages**:
  - Python (for core functionality)
  - JavaScript (for the user interface)
- **Libraries and Frameworks**:
  - Vyper: For parsing and analyzing Vyper smart contracts
  - Web3.py: To interact with the Ethereum blockchain
  - Streamlit: For building the user interface
- **Other Technologies**:
  - Docker: For containerization and environment consistency
